DOL Packet Parser
Written by: SmallHorse

This decodes the packets from the Logger and parses out Mob, Mob equips, world objects, merchants and merchant items.

this is a script, no compiling needed.
1. drop the files into the scripts folder in your dol server project
2. drop your data file logged from live into the same folder
3. from the server command window type parselog <filename>
4. wait for the parser to finish.


on a new clean DB, you should find the zone you logged is populated.  if you opened all the merchant windows, all merchant items should be listed.
also world objects, mobs and any equips mob are wearing should be in the db.
